## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Joining and altering multiple designs was the most time consuming task of this job.  Then the fine tuning to make sure all of the aspects functioned well in a responsive manner took a bit of time as well.  Overall it was a journey in CSS to make all the details function correctly.

## Lessons Learned:

Increased my skill in CSS and graphic making on this project through the fine tuning of the website and creating the graphics for the portfolio previews manually.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
